              <div class="name1" id="lion">Lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. </div>
              <div class="name1" id="elephant">Elephants eat between 149 and 169 kg (330-375 lb.) of vegetation daily. Sixteen to eighteen hours, or nearly 80% of an elephant's day is spent feeding. Elephants consume grasses, small plants, bushes, fruit, twigs, tree bark, and roots.</div>
              <div class="name2" id="bear">Most bears are solitary and only interact with their young. Most bears are normally active during the day, unless they encounter humans frequently. Then, they may become nocturnal, to avoid contact. </div>
              <div class="name2" id="crocodile">Habitat— All crocodiles have special glands in their tongues that can get rid of excess salt, so they tend to live in saltwater habitats such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. Alligators do not have these glands, so they prefer to live in freshwater habitats.</div>
